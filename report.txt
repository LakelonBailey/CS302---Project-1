Compilation Command:
    - Makefile is provided, so run "make"

Summary:
    - We worked together in person on this project, with Lakelon writing the code as the "driver"
      and both of us working equally to come up with ideas/structure. Lakelon was primarily focused
      on developing the helper functions and the structs, while Cooper was primarily focused on
      the main function. Because we worked solely on Lakelon's computer, you will notice that all
      GitHub commits came from his profile.
